    <h2>Second paragraph</h2>
    <p>Once there lived a master and his slave. The master sent his slave to the market to buy provisions. He returned frightened for he had seen a woman in the market. She was Death herself and she had made a threatening gesture at him. The slave feared for his life and asked the master to lend him his horse since he wanted to escape death.
    The master obliged and let the slave go. The slave rode the horse all the way to Bagdad. The master then went to the market to investigate. He found Death there standing in the market. He approached her and asked her why she threatened his slave. Death calmly replied that she didn‘t threaten him. In fact, she was surprised to see him there since she had an appointment with him in Samarra later in the evening.
