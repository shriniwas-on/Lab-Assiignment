    <h1>Swachh Bharat</h1>
    <p>Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi exhorted people to fulfill Mahatma Gandhi's vision of Clean India. The 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' is a massive mass movement that seeks to create a Clean India.

Mahatma Gandhi devoted his life so that India attains 'Swarajya'. Now the time has come to devote ourselves towards 'Swachchhata' (cleanliness) of our motherland.</p>
